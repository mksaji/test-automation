# test-automation
This is a Selenium Java POC script which tests few page navigations in http://www.amazon.in
## Following are tested:
    - Home page navigation
    - Sign in (Failure and Success cases)
    - Shopping Cart Navigation
    - Navigation back to Home page
- Selenium IDE was used to record the navigations. Added verifications and asserts with the help of Firebug. 
Then the converted Java code is used to build the Selenium WebDriver project as below:
    - Create a Java Application project in Eclipse, and add the Selenium Java client drivers to the project
    - Create a Java class with the Selenium Java Test code
    - Run the class to see the tests getting executed in Firefox...!
